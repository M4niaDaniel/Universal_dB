# Universal_dB
this is a simple universal code
powerfull enough to display any 
table from any database 

It's just as simple as including the file 'setup.php'
and simply using the function displayTables() by giving it
such arguments as $table(s), $connection and $sql_add is for options like
where and etc. but you can leave it blank. For $table(s)
you can either use a array or variable

I also plan to add a working universal form soon
